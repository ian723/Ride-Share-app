# Andrewber

This is the example application from the [Build A Ride Share App with Laravel and Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFOEU6YNBzw) video, and contains the finished code from the project.

## Get Started

You can either `cd` into each directory and run the separate stacks as individual applications, or use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to spin everything up under Docker containers.

```sh
docker compose up
```

If you have any questions, feature requests, or bugs to report, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/aschmelyun/andrewber/issues/new) and I'll spend some time fixing them in later videos.
